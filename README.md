## Hi!!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Juan TriviÃ±o or Menta (artistic name), a **Web Development** student.

I'm currently learning:
- HTML
- Java
- Python
- Git.......

I enjoy many activities such as:
- Reading
- Writing
- Drawing
- Playing videogames
- That one rotating hobby I get once a year (this year was chess, maybe some other will be calisthenics again)

My profile is not particularly flashy at this point, but it'll get better (I hope)
